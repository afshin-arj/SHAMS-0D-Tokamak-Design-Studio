# v82 Scope — Feasible Pareto & Secondary Objectives

v82 adds trade-off analysis within the feasible domain only.

## Core Additions
- Feasible-only Pareto front computation
- User-declared secondary objectives
- Constraint margin visualization along Pareto fronts

Objectives are metadata and do not drive solvers.
