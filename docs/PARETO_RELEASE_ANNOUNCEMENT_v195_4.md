# SHAMS Pareto Lab — Intelligence & Integrity Upgrade (v195.4)

**Author:** © 2026 Afshin Arjhangmehr

## Summary

This release upgrades Pareto Lab to be *intelligent without optimizing*:
it improves epistemic honesty (confidence and incompleteness signals),
guides user questions (without recommendations), and strengthens auditability.

Key additions:
- Epistemic confidence and incompleteness detector (sampling-based)
- Objective interaction matrix (sign-only couplings)
- Possible-next-questions guidance panel
- Pareto self-audit integrity checklist
- Language calibration guidance for scientific reading

All guarantees remain unchanged:
- 0-D evaluator truth is frozen (Point Designer)
- Feasible-only Pareto (intent-aware hard constraints)
- Deterministic behavior and replayable artifacts
- No recommendation, no optimization, no constraint relaxation
