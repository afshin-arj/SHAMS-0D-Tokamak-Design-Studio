# External Exposure Guardrails (Frozen)

SHAMS is an evidence generator. External exposure must preserve epistemic guarantees.

## Non-claims (frozen)
SHAMS does **not** claim:
- optimality
- cost certainty
- technology readiness
- predictive fidelity beyond its declared 0-D/proxy model

## Required artifacts for any public machine card
- Existence proof capsule
- Margin ledger + dominant resistance
- Conflict map
- Confidence Sweep summary (first-kill under uncertainty)

## Language guardrails
Use: "exists", "fails because", "margin spent", "under uncertainty".  
Avoid: "best", "optimal", "recommended", "wins", "beats".
