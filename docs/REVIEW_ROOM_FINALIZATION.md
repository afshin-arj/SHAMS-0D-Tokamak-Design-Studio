# Review-Room Finalization (Polish Contract)

This document freezes the *review posture* of Reactor Design Forge.

## Tone & language (frozen)
- SHAMS **describes** feasibility, margins, conflicts, and uncertainty.
- SHAMS **does not** rank, recommend, select, or claim optimality.
- Use declarative, audit-like statements. Avoid hype.

## The Review Trinity (every serious machine)
1. **Existence proof**: feasible point + constraint margins + deterministic capsule.
2. **Stress story**: dominant resistance, conflict map, margin spend story, first-kill under uncertainty.
3. **Positioning**: what this machine is for, what it is not for, who should not build it.

## UI posture rules
- Review Mode locks exploration controls.
- Left panel is a **Control Ledger** (contract & evidence), not a settings sidebar.
- Always show *authority boundaries* (frozen evaluator; non-authoritative workspace).
