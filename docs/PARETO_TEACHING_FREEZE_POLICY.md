# Pareto Teaching Layer Freeze Policy

Teaching overlays are permitted only if they:
- Are purely explanatory (no prescriptive language)
- Are deterministic and template-driven
- Do not change defaults in a way that alters interpretation for expert users
- Are visually subtle and dismissible

Teaching content (tooltips/callouts) is considered part of the frozen semantics once released.
Changing teaching text or callout behavior requires the same review rigor as changing core UI semantics.
