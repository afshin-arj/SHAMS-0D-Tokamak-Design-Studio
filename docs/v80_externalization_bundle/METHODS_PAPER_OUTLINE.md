# SHAMS–FUSION-X Methods Paper (Outline)

## 1. Introduction
- Motivation: limits of optimization-first fusion system studies
- Need for explicit feasibility auditing

## 2. Philosophical Framework
- Constraint-first modeling
- Feasibility as a binary scientific claim
- Separation of physics, numerics, and UI

## 3. Constraint Handling
- Explicit constraint declaration
- Hard feasibility boundaries
- No penalty-based relaxation

## 4. Solver Architecture
- Continuation-based solvers
- Backend pluralism
- Deterministic execution

## 5. Failure as a First-Class Result
- Infeasibility
- Numerical degeneracy
- Continuation termination
- Diagnostic taxonomy

## 6. Validation Strategy
- Literature benchmarks (λq, bootstrap, REBCO/ARC)
- Validation-only philosophy

## 7. Reproducibility & Auditability
- Version/date tagging
- Telemetry disclosure
- Replayability guarantees

## 8. Comparison to Optimization-First Frameworks
- Conceptual (non-competitive) comparison to PROCESS
- Epistemic differences

## 9. Limitations & Non-Goals
- What SHAMS does not attempt
- Scope boundaries

## 10. Conclusion
- SHAMS as a diagnostic scientific instrument
