# v394 — Design Family Governance (Scan Lab)

This example demonstrates how to use the **Design Family Governance Engine (v394)** from the UI.

## Steps

1. Launch SHAMS UI.
2. Go to **🗺️ Scan Lab**.
3. Run a **cartography scan** (any X–Y axes; Reactor intent recommended).
4. Open the collapsed expander:
   - **👪 Design family governance (v394.0.0)**
5. Choose an **Intent lens** and click **Build families**.
6. Download the resulting JSON artifact:
   - `shams_scan_design_families_v394.json`

## Notes

- v394 is **exploration/governance only**.
- It does not modify the frozen evaluator, constraints, or feasibility.
- Families are connected regions sharing the same deterministic regime signature.
