# PATCH NOTES v175.1

- Fix: Results no longer disappear after download (cached Point Designer results render on rerun).
- Fix: Panel Availability Map focus renderer now resolves panel functions reliably (no false 'not found').
- Fix: VERSION now read relative to codebase, not Streamlit working directory.
