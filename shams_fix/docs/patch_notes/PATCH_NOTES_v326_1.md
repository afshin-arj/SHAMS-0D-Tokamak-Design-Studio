# PATCH NOTES — v326.1 Public Repository Hardening

This patch prepares SHAMS for clean publication on GitHub **without modifying frozen truth**.

## Added
- `LICENSE` (Apache-2.0) and `NOTICE` (attribution + scientific/regulatory disclaimer)
- `README.md` (public entrypoint; scope and non-scope clearly stated)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` (frozen truth doctrine + contribution boundaries)
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- `SECURITY.md`
- `.gitignore` aligned with permanent hygiene rules

## Changed
- `VERSION` / `VERSION.txt` → 326.1
- Manifests regenerated

## Not changed (by design)
- No modifications to evaluator equations, closures, or constraint governance.
- No changes to optimization firewalls, authority bundles, or UI wiring.
