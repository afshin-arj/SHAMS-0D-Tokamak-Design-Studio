# PATCH NOTES — v89.1 (2026-01-08)

Hotfix: UI persistence + radial build PNG caption/legend clarity.

Fixed / improved:
- Point Designer: results persist after clicking download buttons (Streamlit rerun-safe via session_state caching).
- Cached radial build PNG bytes for stable downloads.
- Radial build plot layout: legend/xlabel spacing corrected to prevent mixed/overlapping captions in exported PNG.

Unchanged:
- Physics
- Solvers
- Defaults
