# SHAMS External Exposure Checklist (v208)

This checklist is a **process gate**, not a feature.

**Rule:** External exposure is permitted only after the items below are satisfied.

---

## 1) Language & posture freeze
- [ ] No UI text implies "best", "optimal design", or recommendations.
- [ ] All modes preserve non-prescriptive posture.
- [ ] "Truth" is consistently described as frozen evaluator outputs (Point Designer).

## 2) Review-room readiness
- [ ] Review Mode exists and locks interactive search/knobs.
- [ ] Every candidate can export the **Review Trinity**:
  - Existence Proof
  - Stress Story
  - Positioning
- [ ] Hostile review "attack simulation" is exportable (scaffold + evidence pointers).

## 3) Topology grounding
- [ ] Forge candidates can be grounded in a Scan Atlas (when available).
- [ ] Grounding is descriptive: basin label + nearest-point context.
- [ ] No topology grounding modifies feasibility truth.

## 4) Trade-off semantics
- [ ] Pareto Lab language is tightened to "trade-off slice" / "non-dominated feasible".
- [ ] Pareto output is explicitly non-prescriptive and feasible-only.

## 5) Exposure packet
- [ ] One downloadable "exposure packet" exists (docs only) containing:
  - Manifesto / Trust boundaries
  - Freeze statements
  - Example replay capsule
  - Example review packet

**Locked conclusion:**

PROCESS searches for machines.
SHAMS determines what machines can exist — and why.
