# Flagship Case Study (v211 draft)

Goal: produce one canonical, publishable case that demonstrates SHAMS end-to-end.

## Deliverables
- One Forge casebook with 2–4 cases (same intent, different lenses)
- Candidate archive with regime taxonomy coverage
- A final reviewed candidate with:
  - Existence Proof
  - Stress Story (conflicts + margin spend narrative)
  - Positioning
  - Confidence Sweep summary
- Deterministic replay capsule + capsule-to-figures bundle

## Suggested baseline
- Intent: **Power Reactor (net-electric)**
- Reference context: ARC-class / compact HTS high-field
- Budget posture: feasibility-first, conservative constraints

This is not a claim of optimality; it is a documented existence proof.
