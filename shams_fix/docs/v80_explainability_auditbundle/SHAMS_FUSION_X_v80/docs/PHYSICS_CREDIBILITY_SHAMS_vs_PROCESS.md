# Physics Credibility Narrative: SHAMS vs PROCESS (Philosophical)

This document explains *how SHAMS differs from PROCESS philosophically*, without claiming superiority of predictions.

## PROCESS (optimization-first)
Typical systems workflows emphasize:
- objective-driven optimization
- constraints as penalties or soft limits
- success measured primarily by convergence and optima

This paradigm is effective for exploration.

## SHAMS (constraint-first feasibility auditing)
SHAMS inverts the ordering:
- **If a configuration is not feasible, it does not exist**
- failure is a first-class scientific output
- constraints are explicit, audited, and margin-ranked
- continuation provides interpretable trajectories across regimes
- transparency is built into the UI and solver traces

## Scientific implication
SHAMS positions itself as **epistemically conservative**:
- avoids silent extrapolation beyond validated envelopes
- surfaces constraint dominance and violation magnitude
- supports reproducible, reviewable, regulator-friendly analyses

## Positioning statement
“SHAMS-FUSION-X is a feasibility-auditing framework for fusion systems that exposes, rather than obscures,
the boundary between physical possibility and numerical convenience.”
