# Model Scope Card (0窶船)

## Included (authoritative within scope)
- Deterministic 0窶船 plasma + engineering surrogate evaluation
- Explicit constraint gating with signed margins
- Plant closure / recirculating power / net-electric bookkeeping (proxy level)

## Proxy-based gates (screening)
- Divertor heat flux (q_div proxy)
- Neutronics / TBR (proxy)
- Structural stress (proxy model)

## Not included (out of scope)
- 2窶船/3窶船 edge/divertor detachment physics
- Time-dependent disruption/ELM dynamics
- Full neutronics transport / activation

**Interpretation:** empty or infeasible regions are results, not errors.
