maturity:
  level: exploratory
  trl: 2
  notes:
    - Deterministic bookkeeping model intended for scoping and comparative scans.
    - Uses simplified impurity cooling curve proxies; do not treat as predictive without calibration.

  inputs:
    zeff: [1.0, 4.0]
  outputs:
    Prad_core_MW: [0.0, 5000.0]

  what_it_does: |
    Computes core radiation channels as:
      - Bremsstrahlung (hydrogenic mixture proxy)
      - Synchrotron (bounded proxy)
      - Impurity line radiation via Lz(Te) proxy and a declared impurity mix
  proxy_vs_authority:
    authoritative:
      - Deterministic bookkeeping: Prad terms subtract from Pin to form P_SOL.
    proxy:
      - Cooling curve and impurity mix are simplified; no transport or edge physics.
  failure_modes:
    - If inputs are missing or nonphysical, terms are clamped and evaluation continues.
