  "notes": [
    "TF vs PF/CS split is governed by cost_k_tf and cost_k_pf as a deterministic share. Magnitude follows the legacy magnet proxy.",
    "Heating/CD CAPEX proxy scales with launched auxiliary/CD power (P_CD_launch_MW or fallback Paux_MW).",
    "Tritium plant CAPEX proxy scales with tritium throughput (T_burn_kg_per_day) when available; otherwise returns 0 for that component."
