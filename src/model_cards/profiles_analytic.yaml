name: Analytic profiles (½-D scaffold)
version: v1
module: src/physics/profiles.py
entrypoint: physics.profiles.build_profiles_from_volume_avgs
maturity:
  level: exploratory
  trl: 2
  notes:
    - Provides deterministic analytic profiles for diagnostics.
    - Used to compute gradient proxies and optional pedestal surrogate.
validity:
  inputs: {}

card:
  what_it_does: |
    Generates analytic parabolic/pedestal profiles consistent with volume-averaged
    inputs. Used for: gradient proxies, radiation sensitivity hooks, bootstrap sensitivity.
  proxy_vs_authority:
    authoritative:
      - Deterministic shape generation and derived averages.
    proxy:
      - No transport solution; shapes are assumed and bounded.
  failure_modes:
    - If generation fails, evaluation continues with legacy 0-D bookkeeping.
