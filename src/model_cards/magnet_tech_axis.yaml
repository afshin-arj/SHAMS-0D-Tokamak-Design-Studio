name: Magnet technology axis (HTS/LTS/Cu)
version: v1
module: src/engineering
entrypoint: engineering.tf_coil + physics.plant
maturity:
  level: exploratory
  trl: 3
  notes:
    - Technology axis is explicit and stamped into artifacts.
    - SC margin uses critical-surface proxies; copper uses I^2R with winding-pack proxy.

  what_it_does: |
    Makes TF conductor technology explicit:
      - HTS/LTS: report current-density margin and apply policy gating
      - Copper: compute I^2R coil power and couple into recirculating power
  proxy_vs_authority:
    authoritative:
      - Technology selection and bookkeeping are explicit.
    proxy:
      - Critical surface and winding-pack geometry are simplified proxies.
