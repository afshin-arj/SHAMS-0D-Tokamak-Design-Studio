name: Inboard radial build explicit stack closure
version: 1.0.0
module: engineering.radial_stack_solver
entrypoint: inboard_stack_closure
assumptions:
- 1-D midplane inboard stack; ignores 3D shaping/CAD
- Thicknesses are additive; gaps are explicit knobs
validity:
  note: Use for conceptual sizing; verify with CAD for final designs
uncertainty_notes:
- 'Main sensitivity: thickness budgets and coil inner radius definition'
maturity:
  trl: 4
  envelope: baseline
  notes: Default maturity tag added in v35; update per proxy.
